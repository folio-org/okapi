System requirements
-------------------

The Okapi software has the following compile-time dependencies:

* Java 8

* Apache Maven 3.3.x or higher

In addition, the test suite must be able to bind to ports 9230-9239 to
succeed.

*Note: If tests fail, the API Gateway may be unable in some cases to
shut down microservices that it has spawned, and they may need to be
terminated manually.*

Quick start
-----------

To build and run:

    $ mvn install
    $ mvn exec:exec

Okapi listens on port 9130.
